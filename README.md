Description of repository:

A collaborative repository for the development of our web application (A higher/lower guessing game based on global country populations)

Front-end description:

The front-end of this project utilizes all of the following technologies:
    HMTL
    CSS
    JAVASCRIPT
    PYTHON
    BOOTSTRAP

#STYLES#
The styling was done in a way to emphasise strong colours and fluid animations on buttons/menus.
The vast majority of styling is found in "app/static/styles/style.css"
Styling focused on using the theme of yellow+black as well as smooth transitions.

#JAVASCRIPT#
The javascript can be found imbedded within the html files with respect to the template they work for.
The majority of javascript utilizes the DocumentObjectModel too access objects through their ID's.
With access, the styling of those objects are changed on button clicks and hovers.
A majority of javascript functions have bodies which alter the display style of objects.
This is an easy way to have objects disappear (display: none).
And then to re-appear (display: block/flex).
This is how the pop-ups (eg. login) were implemented.

#FONT-AWESOME#
The font-awesome library was used to get icons for the web-page.
Icons such as close buttons, and list buttons were used.

#TEMPLATES#
The main template is index.html which contains login, leaderboards and various links.
register.html contains the register form which adds accounts to the database.
about.html contains information regarding the game/website/developers.
There are 3 gaming templates, those being easy.html, normal.html, hard.hmtl.
They all contains a version of the higher or lower game corresponding to difficulty.
